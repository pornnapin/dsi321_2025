# Project DSI321: Real-Time Data Pipeline with Visualization
## Bangkok Air Quality Dashboard with Streamlit, Prefect & LakeFS

### ðŸ”Ž Project Overview
This project is part of the DSI321: Big Data Infrastructure course. The course emphasizes applying modern data engineering tools to solve real-world problems through the development of end-to-end data pipelines.

This project focuses on air quality monitoring in Bangkok, with an emphasis on tracking PM2.5 levels and the Air Quality Index (AQI) in near real-time. The system is designed to be automated, scalable, and reproducibleâ€”leveraging tools such as Prefect, Streamlit, LakeFS, and Docker to ingest, process, and visualize air quality data across various districts in Bangkok.

#### ðŸ§© Core Components
Real-Time Data Ingestion from LakeFS
Air quality data (PM2.5 and AQI) is stored in a version-controlled Parquet format using LakeFS. This ensures reproducibility and complete tracking of data updates.

Scheduled Processing with Prefect
A Prefect flow runs hourly to retrieve the latest data from LakeFS. This keeps the system continuously updated and maintains data freshness for visualization.

Interactive Visualization via Streamlit
The dashboard features:

A color-coded interactive map showing AQI levels by district
Time-series charts for AQI trends over recent hours
A dropdown to select specific districts
Data Version Control with LakeFS
LakeFS provides Git-like version control for data, enabling rollback, reproducibility, and auditabilityâ€”crucial for time-sensitive environmental monitoring.

Reproducible Deployment with Docker
All components (Streamlit, Prefect, LakeFS) are containerized for easy setup, consistent environments, and fast deployment.
