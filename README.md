# Project DSI321: Real-Time Data Pipeline with Visualization
## Bangkok Air Quality Dashboard with Streamlit, Prefect & LakeFS

### 🔎 Project Overview
This project is part of the DSI321: Big Data Infrastructure course. The course emphasizes applying modern data engineering tools to solve real-world problems through the development of end-to-end data pipelines.

This project focuses on air quality monitoring in Bangkok, with an emphasis on tracking PM2.5 levels and the Air Quality Index (AQI) in near real-time. The system is designed to be automated, scalable, and reproducible—leveraging tools such as Prefect, Streamlit, LakeFS, and Docker to ingest, process, and visualize air quality data across various districts in Bangkok.

#### 🧩 Core Components
Real-Time Data Ingestion from LakeFS
Air quality data (PM2.5 and AQI) is stored in a version-controlled Parquet format using LakeFS. This ensures reproducibility and complete tracking of data updates.

Scheduled Processing with Prefect
A Prefect flow runs hourly to retrieve the latest data from LakeFS. This keeps the system continuously updated and maintains data freshness for visualization.

Interactive Visualization via Streamlit
The dashboard features:

A color-coded interactive map showing AQI levels by district
Time-series charts for AQI trends over recent hours
A dropdown to select specific districts
Data Version Control with LakeFS
LakeFS provides Git-like version control for data, enabling rollback, reproducibility, and auditability—crucial for time-sensitive environmental monitoring.

Reproducible Deployment with Docker
All components (Streamlit, Prefect, LakeFS) are containerized for easy setup, consistent environments, and fast deployment.
